# Search paths for the above computer.  If you add more data, you should add
# it's location to the search paths below

# Syntax
# Include a macro (only at the start of the file)
# Macros are declared before they are used.  They are replaced as the paths
# are read in (only once).  Note that 'product' is automatically a macro
# M macro_name=path_to_folder

# [source] (e.g. MODIS, CERES, DARDAR)
# - [product1|product2] (products following a specific pattern, e.g. MASK, CLOUD,
#    split multiple with pipes - the actual product is automatically replaced where {product} is used)

# Path syntax is the same as the python string formatting syntax (what a coincidence...)
# Use {variable} to make a substitution - can be a macro or a variable from the readin function
# {doy:0>3} left pads the variable doy with 0s to a width of three characters
# * can be used as a wildcard (e.g. for MODIS files that include the processing date
#     The first file is often the one that is returned (depending on how locator.search is called)
# Note that * can also be passed as an argument to locator.search, e.g. if you want to return all the
#  MODIS granules for a specific day
